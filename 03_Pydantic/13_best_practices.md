# Best Practices for Pydantic

## Model Organization
- Define leaf models first - models with no dependencies
- Build upward - Gradually compose more complex mode
- Use clear naming - Make relationships obvious
- Group related models - Keep models in logical modules

## Performance Considerations
- Deep Nesting impacts performance - Keep reasonable
- Large Lists of Nested models -  consider pagination
- Circular references - Use carefully, may cause memory issues
- Lazy Loading - Consider for expensive nested computations

## Data Modeling
- Model real-world relationships - Mirror your domain structure
- Use optional appropriately - Not all relationships are required
- Consider Union types - For polymorphic relationships
- Validate business rules - use model validators for cross model logic
